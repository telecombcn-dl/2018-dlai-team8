# Deep Stochastic Policy Gradient Agent

## Deterministic vs Stochastic

Depending on how the policy is defined classify agents as:
* Deterministic: Outputs the action the agent will execute for a given state. Value-based agents such as DQN are exmples of deterministic agents.

* Stochastic: Outputs a probability distribution over actions. The action executed action is samples from this distribution
