### Experiment 1: Notebook Exp1 --> cartpole env
The first experiment we will carry out will be adapting the code from lab06 reinforment learning by Victor Campos to work with PyTorch.

- Critical part: Adapting the policy gradient update!!!!

### Experiment 2: Notebook Exp2 --> cartpole env
The second experiment will consist on adding a replay memory to the agent, and sample data from it to train.

### Experiment 3: Notebook Exp3 --> lunar lander env
The third experiment will consist on adapting the agent developed before in a more challenging environment
Bigger observation space + Bigger action space (also discrete)


### Experiment 4: Notebook Exp4 --> cartpole env
The fourth experiment will consist on adapting the agent developed before in Exp1 to work directly with the environment images instead of the observation space.
